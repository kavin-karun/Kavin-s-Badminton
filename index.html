<h1 style = "text-align:center;">History of Badminton</h1>
<p style = "font-family:Lucida Calligraphy;">The game of badminton originated in Siam, China over 2,000 years ago. It was brought to England in 1870 and was played somewhat like tennis. After being played in Canada, badminton arrived in America and has been popular since 1929. Since 1992, badminton has been an Olympic sport, with bird speeds reaching 100 m.p.h.</p>

<h1>Rackets</h1>
<p style = "font-family:Lucida Calligraphy;">The earliest badminton rackets had wooden frames. Players sought to have lighter-weight rackets to increase their speed on the court, and they switched to aluminum frames, and then later used carbon fiber composite materials for even lighter rackets. The traditional oval shape of the badminton racket has given way to other shape, such as isometric and diamond, or tear-shaped. The isometric size increases the area of the racket known as the “sweet spot,” which is the area of the strings where the player can deliver the most powerful hit to the shuttlecock. Originally, badminton strings were made from natural animal gut. To improve string tension and also to increase the speed of the game, most players use synthetic materials like nylon which are cheaper and provide the same qualities as the natural strings. The grip on the badminton racket has also moved toward the use of more synthetic materials. Polyurethane and other kinds of toweling grips help the player from losing his hold on the handle and build up its diameter so his hand is comfortable.</p>

<h1>Shuttles</h1>
<p style = "font-family:Lucida Calligraphy;">Shuttlecocks actually originated in England, where the upper class was hooked on badminton and each birdie was handcrafted using leather, cork and feathers. Bauer reverse-engineered the shuttlecock, using goose feathers and cork, and he was selling them in bulk by 1934. The "shuttle" part of the name is derived from its back-and-forth motion during the game, resembling the shuttle of a 14th-century loom, while the "cock" part of the name is derived from the resemblance of the feathers to those on a rooster. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation.</p>
