<td>For a backhand serve there are many different serves. For example a low serve to the "T" would be a short serve landing close to the middle and the front.
Or a wide flick would be a high or flat serve to the back which would land in the corner farthest away from the server.</td>

<td>For a forehand serve there are also many variations such as: a drive serve, a high serve and a short serve. A drive serve is where you hit the shuttle into the opponenent backhand corner which means that the response will most likely be very weak. A high serve is a serve which is intended to give the server time to get ready for the opponents next shot. Another benefit of the high serve is that if it has been served high enough then the opponent will hit the feathers first as the shuttle is coming down vertically making it very hard to get back.</td>

<td>The smash shot is hit with power and speed downward into the opponent's court. The angle and the steepness of the shuttlecock's trajectory make it hard for the opponent to retrieve and return. You should always be aiming for your opponent racket dominant hip, it means to try to hit smash near your opponent hip area (racket dominant) because in that way he will get confused whether to take the shuttle with his forehand or his backhand which will give you a week reply from him.</td>
